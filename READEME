#Welcome to nnangpress

- Make sure boot is using clojure version 1.8.0

#Application architecture

-All the data is in a single atom

-Reference cursors are used to create an api to simplify management of this 'monolith' data
structure which may get reasonably complicated.

## The routes map

-

## General

- Components should be as self-contained as possible, essentially reject the 'waterfall' data model

## Broadcast system

- Components should subscrive to edit events that affect them. For example a component that
can have it's text edited should subscribe to the edit mode event

## Reference Cursors

- Don't get observers and ordinary ref-curosrs mixed up
